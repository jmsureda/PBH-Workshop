This repository was created to share the code for the FoF 2022 workshop on Primordial black holes.

## Requirements

- numpy
- pandas

To start working download the source code (or clone the repository), execute jupyter and go to the directory where you located the source code. I have prepared an Exercice jupyter notebook with some pre-built code to help you get started.
